## What is Graph?
- Graph is a **non-linea**r data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(V, E).

## Types of Graph?
1. **Undirected Graph**
  - A graph in which edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

2. **Directed Graph**
    - A graph in which edge has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

3. **Weighted Graph**
    - A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph.

## Basic Terminolgies of Graph
1. **Adjacent Node**
   - A node N is adjacent to node M if there is an edge from M --> N.
   - N is called **Successor** of M.
   - M is called **Predecessor** of N.
2. **Path**
   - A path is a sequence of vertices/edges that connect two nodes.
3. **Cycle**
   - A Cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repetitions of vertices (except the starting and ending vertex, which are the same).
4. **Acyclic**

5. **Degree**

**NOTE:** Degree = In-Degree + Out-Degree

6. **Directed Graph** [with **m** nodes]
   - No of possible Pairs = m * (m-1)
   - No of possible Edges = m * (m-1)  [Because (u,v) != (v,u)]
6. **UnDirected Graph** [with **m** nodes]
   - No of possible Pairs = m * (m-1)
   - No of possible Edges = m * (m-1) / 2
