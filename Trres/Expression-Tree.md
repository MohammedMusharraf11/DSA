# Expression Tree

The expression tree is a binary tree in which each internal node corresponds to the operator and each leaf node corresponds to the operand so for example, the expression tree for 3 + ((5+9)*2) would be:

An expression tree is a binary tree used to represent expressions. Its nodes correspond to operators and operands. Here's a structured set of notes for understanding and implementing expression trees:

### Expression Tree Overview
## Definition:
A binary tree where:
- Leaf nodes represent operands (constants or variables).
- Internal nodes represent operators (+, -, *, /, etc.).
## Purpose:
- To evaluate expressions efficiently.
- To convert between infix, prefix, and postfix expressions.

###  Properties of Expression Tree
Binary Tree: Each operator node has exactly two children (binary operators).
**Traversal:**
- Inorder Traversal: Yields the original infix expression (with parentheses for clarity).
- Preorder Traversal: Yields the prefix expression.
- Postorder Traversal: Yields the postfix expression.

## Construction of Expression Tree

### From Postfix Expression
1. Create an empty stack.
2. Traverse the postfix expression:
   - **If the character is an operand**:
     - Create a node and push it onto the stack.
   - **If the character is an operator**:
     - Pop two nodes from the stack.
     - Make them the left and right children of a new operator node.
     - Push the new node onto the stack.
3. At the end, the remaining node in the stack is the root of the expression tree.

## Evaluation of Expression Tree

### Algorithm
1. Perform a **postorder traversal** of the tree:
   - Recursively evaluate the left subtree.
   - Recursively evaluate the right subtree.
   - Apply the operator at the current node to the results.
2. If a node is a **leaf (operand)**, return its value directly.
